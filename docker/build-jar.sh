# Builds the patched FullNode.jar from docker/src and stages it at
# tre/FullNode.jar. The consumer's container config mounts that
# file over the image's stock jar so the container starts already
# patched — no in-flight restart, no race with pre-approve.
#
# Run this once after each change to docker/src/**/*.java, and after
# every TRE image bump. The output jar is gitignored.
#
# Strategy:
#   1. Copy the stock FullNode.jar out of the TRE image (`docker create`
#      + `docker cp`; the node never starts).
#   2. Compile the patch sources in a throwaway JDK container against
#      that jar. TRE 2.0 ships a jlink-trimmed JRE without javac, so
#      compiling inside the TRE image (what this script did for TRE 1.x,
#      which had OpenJDK 8) no longer works. The `--release` level is
#      derived from the stock jar's own class-file version (52 → 8,
#      61 → 17) so the emitted classes always load on the runtime the
#      image actually ships.
#   3. Repack: every .class produced by the compile replaces the
#      corresponding entry in the stock jar (new classes are added).
#
# Env knobs:
#   TRE_IMAGE  image to patch. Default tronbox/tre:dev — consumers retag
#              their pinned digest to that name (see tron-contracts
#              scripts/pin-tre-image.sh), so the default follows the pin.
#   JDK_IMAGE  compiler image. Default eclipse-temurin:17-jdk. Must be at
#              least the runtime's Java level so javac can read the jar.
#   TRE_JAR    path of FullNode.jar inside TRE_IMAGE. Auto-detected.
